# BricksVR returned

This is a fork of the open source mirror of BricksVR the Unity game. The purpose of this fork is not only to restore the game to a playable state but even add some new features.

All assets generated for/by BricksVR including Brick models and artwork have been open-sourced by Nat. This work is licensed under MIT and can be re-purposed or copied directly into personal or commercial projects without attribution.

You can find the original game for the Oculus Quest [here](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4018602774873329/).

## Running the project

- Clone the repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/FigureVR/BricksVR-Rebuilt.git`
- Add project to Unity
### Android Only
- To build the game as an apk you will need to:
  - Go into player settings.
  - Go into publishing settings.
  - Use `user.keystore`.
  - Set the password to `bricks`.

## Licensing

All assets available in this repository (including scripts, materials, 3D models) except the BricksVR name and logos are released for free under the MIT license. In short, the MIT license permits virtually all use, distribution, and modification for personal or commercial use. The full license is available in the LICENSE file.

Some premium assets have been removed from this project, including some music and packages that were paid for by BricksVR but cannot be redistributed for free.

## Notes about the project

This was Nat's very first Unity project. If you're combing through the code, expect some odd, inefficient, and anti-idiomatic code. I began to focus on better code towards the end of the project but the codebase is still littered with very low quality work.
